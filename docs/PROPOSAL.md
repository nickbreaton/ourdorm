# Resident Advisor Dashboard

## Prompt

> Develop/Extend a web application for a community group to encourage communication about activities and projects.

## Description

### Purpose

At UNC Charlotte, each dorm has a group of RAs (Resident Advisors), one GA
(Graduate Assistant), and one REC (Resident Education Coordinator). These people
are responsible for making their dorms safe, welcoming, and enjoyable environments.
However, clear communication between all members of the staff is often hard to
achieve due to differing and busy schedules. Through the use of a central dashboard,
this can be more easily maintained.

One major responsibility of the RAs, is to be on duty at a certain time.
This means they _must_ be in the office of their dorm at a time scheduled by their
GA or REC. These times are on a rotating schedule, and are sometimes hard to remember.
RAs are also responsible for scheduling activities for residents around the dorm.
Also, all members of the housing staff are required to have a weekly meeting to
discuss their group performance and how to enhance it.

A central piece of the Resident Advisor Dashboard, will be a calendar-like interface,
responsible for facilitating the scheduling of RA duties and activities. With this data
the Resident Advisor Dashboard will also remind any party of an upcoming duty,
activity, or meeting involving them, inherently increasing communication building-wide
and allowing the staff to encourage their residents to participate in activities.

### Content

- __Calendar__ is the central interface for all events that an RA could participate in.
It will provide a window into upcoming duties and events and also allow for easy
trading and approval of duties. Duties will originally be populated by a GA or REC,
but can the be modified by the appropriate RA.
